This is Business::OnlinePayment::PayflowPro, a Business::OnlinePayment
back end module for PayPal Payflow Pro.  It is only useful if you have
a merchant account with PayPal Payment Services:

As of 0.07, this module communicates with the Payflow gateway directly and no
longer requires the Payflow Pro SDK.  Thanks to Phil Lobbes for this great
work.

The Payflow API that this module interfaces with is not yet an officially
supported service and is still subject to change.  At this time, you need to
contact payflowintegrator@paypal.com for a certification ID to connect and run
transactions using this module.

Business::OnlinePayment is a generic interface for processing payments
through online credit card processors, online check acceptance houses,
etc.  (If you like buzzwords, call it an "multiplatform
ecommerce-enabling middleware solution").
