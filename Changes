	  Josh Rosenbaum

1.00  Sat Aug 22 01:13:34 EDT 2009 plobbes
	- bump version to 1.00, should have probably done this with
	  0.07 as it was a radical enough departure from 0.06, also
	  BOP 3.x is no longer just a developers release
	- rt.cpan.org#48696 Use CGI::Util instead of CGI
	  Josh Rosenbaum
	  + updated code to be faster/more efficient
	- rt.cpan.org#48816 Request Encoding Issue & Missing fields
	  Josh Rosenbaum
	  + use PayPal custom encoding (not URL encoding) per PP spec
	  + added missing shipping parameters similar to Authorize.Net
	- rt.cpan.org#48820 %content not reloaded after mapping breaks credits
	  Josh Rosenbaum
	  + fix a problem with credits where the ACCT, AMT, and
	    EXPDATE were being required, because the ORIGID detection
	    code was not working

	- update server names per latest PayPal docs:
	   payflow.verisign.com => payflowpro.verisign.com
	   pilot-payflowpro.verisign.com => pilot-payflowpro.paypal.com
	[0.07_06 Sat Oct 18 14:15:03 EDT 2008] plobbes
	- include most of the patches from Frédéric Brière at fbriere.net
	- request_id now only generates a new id when not set
	- cvv2_code brought back for backwards compatibility
	- client_certification_id now default to "ClientCertificationIdNotSet"
	- client_timeout set to 45 by default
	- several doc updates and some reorg
	[0.07_05 Wed Apr  4 12:56:57 PDT 2007] ivan
	- add note about inteface & contacting payflowintegrator@paypal.com
	[0.07_04 Tue Mar 13 18:26:12 EDT 2007] ivan
	- ripped out a bunch of hastily-conceived ->param BS more appropriate
	  for implementation in a base class.  Server names were incorrect.
	  Tests were broken (some specific to a particular account).
	- depend on B:OP:HTTPS 0.06 for Crypt::SSLeay fixes
	[0.07_03 Tue Mar 13 18:26:12 EDT 2007] plobbes
	- add "shortcut" param 'client_certification_id' (can be
	  passed as an argument for B::OP->new() which will set the
	  X-VPS-VIT-CLIENT-CERTIFICATION-ID header
	[0.07_02 Tue Mar 13 12:32:57 EDT 2007] plobbes
	- made generic method for deprecating cert_path, etc.
	- doc'd vendor() and partner() as deprecated but will not put
	  out warnings on those (B::OP new() behavior would make this annoying)
	- shortened code for the custom methods (we are not using build_subs())
	- use path() again as "/commit" is not needed/used by PayflowPro HTTPS
	- removed code in submit() related to "/commit"
	- set param("test_server") so the test server name can be changed
	[0.07_01 Mon Mar 12 01:56:58 EDT 2007] plobbes
	- rewrite/updates for new B::OP::PayflowPro using HTTP protocol
	- no longer using PFProAPI.pm (from Verisign/PayPal)
	- cert_path() is now deprecated
	- rewrite/updates for new B::OP::PayflowPro using HTTP protocol
	- no longer use PFProAPI.pm from Verisign/PayPal
	- now using name-value pair transactions
	- require: CGI to parse name-value pair responses from server
	- require: Digest::MD5 to generate (hopefully) unique
	  request_id which is required by PayflowPro HTTP protocol
	- new methods: request_id(), param(), debug(), expdate_mmyy()
	- renamed internal methods to start with an underscore
	- removed unused remap_fields() method
	- if unable to parse expiration given in %content no longer croak,
	  but let PayflowPro servers attempt to deal with the value as-is
	- submit() now two phased per PFP HTTP protocol
	- X-VPS-VIT-CLIENT-CERTIFICATION-ID is required (supposedly
	  this is a temporary requirement from PayPal)
	- request_id() method will generate a hopefully unique id using
	  Digest::MD5 for use in the X-VPS-REQUEST-ID HTTP header.  A
	  'request_id' key may be passed in %content to specify an ID
	- path() is not used as the PFP HTTP protocol uses two
	  different URLs (step 1) /transaction, (step 2) /commit
	- patches to B::OP::HTTPS were required to support needed
	  functionality
	- debug() sets $Business::OnlinePayment::HTTPS::DEBUG for debugging
